# texmf

This repository is for any custom LaTeX class files or packages. Files should be added to `texmf-local/tex/latex`. Depending on the system, `texmf-local` can be found
Linux: ~/texmf
Mac: /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex
Windows: /c/textlive/texmf-local


After changing or adding any files to the directory, you need to rebuild the LaTeX tree by running `texhash` in the command line.

## lis
This is a folder containing class files and related files when writing exams. The class files are essentially a preamble in order to keep the actual exam files at a minimum and to retain consistency in the document layout.
